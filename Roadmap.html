        <h2>What is a Full Stack Developer?</h2>
        <p>A full stack developer is someone who can work on both the front-end (client side) and back-end (server side) of a web application. They are proficient in various technologies that are required to build a fully functional web application.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Front-end:</strong> This refers to the part of the web that users interact with. It includes everything users experience on a website—texts, images, buttons, and the layout.</li>
            <li><strong>Back-end:</strong> This refers to the server-side of the web, where the logic, databases, and server configuration reside. It’s what makes the front-end interactive and dynamic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Role of HTML in Full Stack Development</h2>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web development. It is the language used to create the structure of web pages. As a full stack developer, mastering HTML is essential because it's the foundation for building the front-end of a website. Along with CSS and JavaScript, HTML is crucial for creating an appealing and user-friendly interface.</p>

        <h2>Steps to Become a Full Stack Developer</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Learn the Basics of HTML</h3>
        <p>To start, you need to learn how to write HTML code. HTML forms the structure of a webpage by using tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.</p>
        
        <h4>Basic HTML Example:</h4>
        <pre>
<code>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My First Web Page</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

        </pre>

        <h3>2. Master Front-End Technologies (CSS & JavaScript)</h3>
        <p>HTML is the starting point, but to create interactive and stylish websites, you need to learn <strong>CSS</strong> (Cascading Style Sheets) and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CSS:</strong> Used for styling the HTML structure, defining colors, fonts, layouts, and aesthetics.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Adds interactivity to the web by enabling dynamic features like form validation, animations, and event handling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h4>
        <pre>
<code>
<style>
    body {
        background-color: lightgray;
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }

    h1 {
        color: darkblue;
    }
</style>

<script>
    document.querySelector('h1').addEventListener('click', function() {
        alert('Hello, welcome to my web page!');
    });
</script>
</code>
        </pre>

        <h3>3. Learn Back-End Technologies</h3>
        <p>Once you're comfortable with front-end development, it's time to dive into back-end technologies. For full stack developers, popular back-end technologies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.</li>
            <li><strong>Python:</strong> Used with frameworks like Django or Flask.</li>
            <li><strong>Ruby on Rails:</strong> A powerful Ruby-based web framework.</li>
            <li><strong>PHP:</strong> A widely-used server-side scripting language.</li>
            <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Learn SQL (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Integrate Front-End and Back-End</h3>
        <p>As a full stack developer, you must connect the front-end and back-end of your web applications using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).</p>
        
        <h4>Example: Simple Node.js Server</h4>
        <pre>
<code>
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Hello from the back-end!' });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
</code>
        </pre>

        <h3>5. Version Control with Git</h3>
        <p>Learn how to use <strong>Git</strong> for version control and <strong>GitHub</strong> for managing code repositories. This will help you track changes, collaborate with other developers, and manage projects effectively.</p>

        <h3>6. Build Projects and Practice</h3>
        <p>The key to becoming proficient as a full stack developer is practice. Start by building small projects, such as a personal portfolio, blog site, or task manager, and gradually increase the complexity. By solving real-world problems, you will develop the skills necessary to build powerful web applications.</p>
